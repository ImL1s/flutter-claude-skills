A curated collection of [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) skills for **Flutter / Dart development, testing, mobile app release workflows, and AI-assisted design-to-code pipelines**.

Extracted and sanitized from real-world mobile app development experience.

## Why this repo?

Claude Code skills are reusable, triggerable knowledge packs that the agent loads when your task matches the trigger conditions. Building a solid skill library takes time — you have to discover the patterns, test them in real workflows, and iterate until the agent reliably picks the right one.

This repo gives you a **production-tested starting point** for Flutter-centric teams:

- **Real-world origin** — every skill was extracted from active mobile app development, not invented in isolation.
- **Multi-layer coverage** — testing, debugging, design-to-code, release, monetization, and collaboration workflows.
- **Sanitized & portable** — secrets, personal paths, and company-specific references are stripped out (see [Sanitized placeholders](#sanitized-placeholders)).
- **MIT licensed** — drop it into your project, fork it, remix it.

If you're onboarding a team to Claude Code or want to skip months of trial-and-error discovering which skills actually matter for Flutter work, this is a reasonable baseline.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ImL1s/flutter-claude-skills.git
cp -R flutter-claude-skills/skills/flutter-verify ~/.claude/skills/
# Open Claude Code in any Flutter project — flutter-verify auto-loads on trigger
```

That's it. Repeat `cp -R` for any other skills you want, or symlink the whole `skills/` directory (see [Installation](#installation)).

## Start here

Pick a row by your task, then follow the "Start with" skill and the linked playbook.

## Playbooks

Skills are most useful when **composed**. See [`PLAYBOOKS.md`](./PLAYBOOKS.md) for eight cross-skill composition patterns distilled from real usage:

1. **Pub package release cycle** — `writing-plans` → `flutter-verify`
2. **TDD per task** — `test-driven-development` → `testing-anti-patterns`
3. **Bidirectional code review** — `requesting-code-review` ↔ `receiving-code-review`
4. **Debug Triage** — `systematic-debugging` → `root-cause-tracing`
5. **Figma-to-Code Pipeline** — `figma-use` → `figma-implement-design` → `verify-ui`
6. **Release Preflight Chain** — `release-preflight` → `release-app`
7. **Skill Authoring Loop** — `skill-creator` → `writing-skills`
8. **Firebase + Monetization Init** — `flutter-fullstack-init` or `firebase-flutter-setup` → `admob-ux-best-practices`

Each playbook names the skill chain, when it applies, and anchors to worked examples in [`PLAYBOOKS.md`](./PLAYBOOKS.md).

## Installation

Drop any skill directory into your Claude Code skills path:

```bash
# User-global skills (available in all sessions)
cp -R skills/<skill-name> ~/.claude/skills/

# Project-local skills (only for one project)
cp -R skills/<skill-name> <your-project>/.claude/skills/
```

Or clone and symlink:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ImL1s/flutter-claude-skills.git
ln -s "$(pwd)/flutter-claude-skills/skills/flutter-verify" ~/.claude/skills/flutter-verify
```

Claude Code auto-discovers skills on session start. Trigger conditions are declared in each `SKILL.md` frontmatter.

---

## Skill anatomy

Each skill is a directory containing at minimum a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: |
  One-line summary + when to trigger.
  Triggers: keywords / conditions that activate this skill.
---

## Skill content
...
```

Some skills include helper scripts / templates / reference snippets in the same directory.

---

## Sanitized placeholders

A few skills contain placeholder values you should replace for your project:

| Skill | Placeholder | Replace with |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `flutter-verify` | `/path/to/your/flutter/project` | Your actual Flutter project path |
| `figma-rest-api-scrape` | `YOUR_FIGMA_FILE_KEY` | Your Figma file key (from URL) |
| `figma-playwright-fallback` | `<your-figma-email>` | Your Figma account email |

---

## Contributing

PRs welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines, or the short version:

1. Follow the `SKILL.md` frontmatter format
2. Include clear **trigger conditions** and **when to skip**
3. Add concrete examples with expected output
4. No hardcoded secrets / personal info / company-specific paths
5. Prefer Chinese or English (or both) — whichever serves clarity better
